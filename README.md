## General Information

This is where you would mention what the app does in slightly more detail, what problem it solves and why you built it (if they are not the same thing)

Example: <br/>
This is a simple MERN stack application to track user exercises. It's a helpful app for tracking (exercises or otherwise) and was intended to help me learn Authentiation and continue to work on my fullstack building using the MERN stack.

## Tech Stack

Mention all the languages you used to build the app.

## RELATIVE LINKS

You can define relative links and image paths in your rendered files to help readers navigate to other files in your repository.

[Contribution guidelines for this project](ContributionGuidelines.md)

See the section on [`code`](#code).

## IMAGES

When you want to display an image which is in your repository, you should use relative link (Hover to see titles):

    ![peace](/images/Screenshot%202023-02-13%20at%2012.10.49%20PM.png 'Sometimes I have straight hair')

![peace](/images/Screenshot%202023-02-13%20at%2012.10.49%20PM.png 'Sometimes I have straight hair')

    ![wink][id]

    [id]: /images/Screenshot%202023-02-13%20at%2012.11.01%20PM.png 'Sometimes I have wavey hair'

![wink][id]

[id]: /images/Screenshot%202023-02-13%20at%2012.11.01%20PM.png 'Sometimes I have wavey hair'

    ![kiss](/images/Screenshot%202023-02-13%20at%2012.28.55%20PM.png 'Sometimes I have fancy hair')

![kiss](/images/Screenshot%202023-02-13%20at%2012.28.55%20PM.png 'Sometimes I have fancy hair')

When you want to use an image from the internet you should use the absolute link:

    ![me as Octocat](https://octodex.github.com/images/femalecodertocat.png)

<img alt="me as Octocat" src="https://octodex.github.com/images/femalecodertocat.png" width="400" height="400" />

## CODE

I wish SmartyPants used named entities like `&mdash;`
instead of decimal-encoded entites like `&#8212;`.

Use double backticks for backticked-ed code : `` Use `code` in your Markdown file. ``

```javascript
const = something;

if(yes){
  console.log(yes);
}
```

```javascript
var s = 'JavaScript syntax highlighting';
alert(s);
```

```python
s = "Python syntax highlighting"
print s
```

## STYLING

**This is bold text**

_This text is italicized_

~~This was mistaken text~~

**This text is _extremely_ important**

**_All this text is important_**

Text<sup>This is a superscript text</sup>

Text <sub>This is a subscript text</sub>

## HORIZONTAL RULE

Use \_\_\_ and try to put a blank line before...

...and after a horizontal rule.

## DROPDOWNS

<details> 
<summary>Dropdown Menu</summary>
This could be anything?

Yes, Anything

</details>

    <details>
    <summary>Dropdown Menu</summary>
    Add the following line to your `Profile` by using syntax highlighting:

        This could be anything?

    Yes, Anything

    </details>

<details>
  <summary>Something Else</summary>
  Another dropdown!
</details>

## BLOCKQUOTES

> "Text that is a quote"

### Blockquotes with Multiple Paragraphs

> Dorothy followed her through many of the beautiful rooms in her castle.
>
> The Witch bade her clean the pots and kettles and sweep the floor and keep the fire fed with wood.

### Nested Blockquotes

> Dorothy followed her through many of the beautiful rooms in her castle.
>
> > The Witch bade her clean the pots and kettles and sweep the floor and keep the fire fed with wood.

### Blockquotes with other elements
